  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia Definition">JavaScript</a>, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, multi-paradigm programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
  <img src="js.jpg" width="100%">
  <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. <strong>JavaScript enables <u>interactive web pages</u> and is an essential part of web applications.</strong> The vast majority of websites use it,  and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>
  <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.</p>
